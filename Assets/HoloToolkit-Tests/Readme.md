# HoloToolkit-Tests
This folder will host test scenes and assets that verify functionality of HoloToolkit-Unity components.
Each scene should also include a readme that explains how to verify test each.

Scenes in this folder may be automated and moved into HoloToolkit-UnitTests when/if such tests are written for them.
